CRYPTOGRAPHICALLY SECURE 256 BIT PRIVATE KEY GENERATOR


The program generates 256 bit number, i.e., 64 digit hex number which is not greater than n, the elliptical curve limit according to bitcoin's model


The key is in theory, cryptographically secure, similar to wallet applications. You may test it's security and leave a message if you do :D


Copy both files and paste it in your sources folder for your projects and simply type : #include "privatekey.h"


For now, only the create_private_key function is accessible directly for convenience. Feel free to check out the additional functions used to create the final function


This is part of a bigger blockchain project, and I'm trying to build everything from scratch so stay tuned for more custom blockchain code :D


Have fun tinkering around
