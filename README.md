CRYPTOGRAPHICALLY SECURE 256 BIT PRIVATE KEY GENERATOR


The program generates 256 bit number, i.e., 64 digit hex number which is not greater than n, the elliptical curve limit according to bitcoin's model


The key is in theory, cryptographically secure, similar to wallet applications. You may test it's security and leave a message if you do :D


Have fun tinkering around
